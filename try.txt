Despite much recent progress, prostate cancer continues
to represent a major cause of cancer-related mortality
and morbidity in men. Since early studies on the role of
the androgen receptor that led to the advent of androgen
deprivation therapy in the 1940s, there has long been
intensive interest in the basic mechanisms underlying
prostate cancer initiation and progression, as well as
the potential to target these processes for therapeutic
intervention. Here, we present an overview of major
themes in prostate cancer research, focusing on current
knowledge of principal events in cancer initiation and
progression. We discuss recent advances, including new
insights into the mechanisms of castration resistance,
identification of stem cells and tumor-initiating cells,
and development of mouse models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapuetics. Overall, we highlight the
tremendous research progress made in recent years, and
underscore the challenges that lie ahead.

In 2009, there were ;192,280 new cases of prostate cancer
reported and 27,360 related deaths in the United States
(American Cancer Society 2009). Although the age-adjusted rate of cancer deaths has decreased steadily in the
past 10 years, prostate cancer remains the second leading
cause of cancer death in men. Since we last reviewed this
topic 10 years ago (Abate-Shen and Shen 2000), there have
been numerous advances in basic research on prostate
cancer initiation and progression, as well as new clinical
advances that have improved patient outcome. Below, we
review the principal features of prostate cancer, highlighting key molecular events of initiation and progression and
major targets for clinical intervention. When feasible, we

Major clinical challenges in prostate cancer
Prostate cancer has been recognized as a clinical entity
since antiquity, when it was first described by the ancient
Egyptians, while surgical procedures to remove the prostate were developed >100 years ago (Capasso 2005).
However, the availability of a highly accessible blood
test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has revolutionized
the diagnosis of prostate cancer over the past three
decades. PSA is a kallikrein-related serine protease that
is produced in normal prostate secretions, but is released
into the blood as a consequence of disruption of normal
prostate architecture (Lilja et al. 2008).
Men that have elevated PSA levels typically undergo
biopsy to assess the potential presence of prostate cancer.
Following biopsy, histopathological grading of prostate
tissue is performed by Gleason scoring, which classifies
tumors from 1 to 5 (most to least differentiated) based on
their most prevalent architecture, and assigns a combined
score that is the sum of the two most common patterns
(Mellinger et al. 1967; Epstein 2010). Patients are also
diagnosed by the status of their primary tumors, from
organ-confined to fully invasive (T1–4), with or without
lymph node involvement (N0 or 1), and the presence
and degree of distant metastases (M0 and 1a–c) (Ohori
et al. 1994). If prostate cancer is diagnosed, conventional
treatment regimens include surgical excision of the prostate (radical prostatectomy), or irradiation through external beam therapy or implantation of radioactive ‘‘seeds’’
(brachytherapy). In the case of advanced cancer, these
regimens are usually followed or substituted with androgen deprivation therapy, which initially will reduce tumor
burden and/or circulating PSA to low or undetectable
levels, but ultimately the disease will recur in most cases.
At present, there are several major clinical challenges
associated with this conventional paradigm for prostate
cancer diagnosis and treatment. Each of these significantly
impacts the effective management of prostate cancer, and
is the subject of investigations in basic research on prostate
tumor biology.

Distinguishing indolent vs. aggressive disease

Bone tropism of prostate cancer metastasis

Recent changes in recommendations that now suggest
later and less frequent PSA screenings highlight a major
clinical challenge for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment (Wolf et al. 2010). These new recommendations
were proposed because the widespread use of PSA testing
has led to a vast increase in the diagnosis of patients with
clinically localized low Gleason grade carcinomas that
may not require treatment, since their tumors are relatively indolent. In particular, patients with a Gleason
pattern of 3 or less almost never relapse after local therapy,
and very likely can be managed conservatively with
‘‘watchful waiting’’; nonetheless, a small fraction of these
tumors will progress rapidly and require immediate treatment (Albertsen et al. 2005; Eggener et al. 2007; Lu-Yao
et al. 2009).
Consequently, a major clinical challenge is posed by
the current inability to readily distinguish indolent from
aggressive tumors in prostate cancer patients who present
with low Gleason grade tumors upon biopsy (Sartor et al.
2008). The absence of this prognostic information has led
to a significant ‘‘overtreatment’’ of patients who would
otherwise require only conservative management. Thus,
the impact of treatment on prostate cancer survival is
small, most likely because overdiagnosis and overtreatment dilutes the benefits of therapy for those who require
intervention. This prognostic challenge could be addressed
by better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer
initiation, which should ultimately lead to the identification of biomarkers that distinguish between indolent and
aggressive forms of prostate cancer. At present, however,
available panels of molecular biomarkers do not provide
greater prognostic significance than Gleason grade determination (True et al. 2006).

A third major clinical challenge corresponds to the propensity for advanced prostate cancer to metastasize to
bone, which is primarily responsible for its effect on
patient morbidity as well as mortality. Thus, unlike other
epithelial tumors that occasionally metastasize to bone,
metastatic prostate cancer almost invariably metastasizes to bone, and furthermore displays characteristic
osteoblastic rather than osteolytic lesions (Logothetis and
Lin 2005). Despite the clinical relevance of bone metastasis, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the bone
tropism of prostate cancer are not well understood. This
gap in knowledge is due in part to difficulties in obtaining
metastatic tissue from patients, as well as to difficulties
in generating mouse models that display bone metastasis.
At present, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the bone tropism of prostate
cancer metastasis. Experimental models for investigation
of bone metastases are limited to a small range of xenograft
models that typically rely on intracardiac or intratibial
injection of highly transformed tumor cells to induce
metastases (Corey et al. 2002; Singh and Figg 2005). To
date, despite the availability of genetically engineered
mouse models that display secondary metastases, there
is no autochthonous model that reliably generates bone
metastases at an appreciable frequency.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer
Circulating androgens are essential for normal prostate
development as well as the onset of prostate cancer
through their interactions with the androgen receptor
(AR). As shown by Huggins and colleagues in the 1940s
(Huggins and Hodges 1941), removal of testicular androgens by surgical or chemical castration will lead to
regression of prostate tumors. However, androgen depletion is usually associated with the recurrence of
prostate cancer, as monitored by rising PSA levels, and
this recurrent disease is termed ‘‘castration resistant.’’
(The term ‘‘castration resistance’’ has generally replaced
‘‘androgen independence’’ in usage, as it has become
apparent that advanced prostate cancer remains dependent on AR function, as discussed below.) Unfortunately,
castration-resistant prostate cancer has been essentially
untreatable, with the most effective standard chemotherapeutic regimens resulting in a mean increase in survival
time of 2 mo (Petrylak et al. 2004; Tannock et al. 2004).
Therefore, a second major clinical challenge that could be
significantly impacted by basic research in prostate
cancer biology is the elucidation of pathways of castration resistance, which could lead to the identification of
new therapeutic approaches.

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

Development of the prostate gland
Anatomy and histology
In men, the prostate gland is a walnut-sized tissue
surrounding the urethra at the base of the bladder, and
produces important components of the seminal fluid.
Although the adult prostate lacks discernible lobular
structure, the classic work of McNeal (1969, 1981,
1988) defined the human prostate as having a zonal
architecture, corresponding to central, periurethral transition, and peripheral zones, together with an anterior
fibromuscular stroma (Timms 2008). Importantly, the
outermost peripheral zone occupies the most volume,
and harbors the majority of prostate carcinomas. In contrast, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common nonmalignant condition found in older men, arises from the
transition zone.
Unlike the human prostate, the mouse prostate consists
of multiple lobes that have distinct patterns of ductal
branching, histological appearance, gene expression, and
secretory protein expression (Cunha et al. 1987). These
correspond to the ventral, lateral, dorsal, and anterior
lobes, with the dorsal and lateral lobes often combined as
the dorsolateral lobe for analysis. Although it is sometimes
asserted that the mouse dorsolateral lobe is most analogous to the human peripheral zone, particularly with
respect to prostate cancer, there is no consensus agreement among pathologists to support this conclusion
(Shappell et al. 2004). However, analyses of gene expression profiling data support the idea that the dorsolateral
lobe is most similar to the peripheral zone of the human
prostate (Berquin et al. 2005).

Molecular genetics of prostate cancer

At the histological level, both the mouse and human
prostate contain a pseudostratified epithelium with three
differentiated epithelial cell types: luminal, basal, and
neuroendocrine (CS Foster et al. 2002; van Leenders and
Schalken 2003; Hudson 2004; Shappell et al. 2004; Peehl
2005). The luminal epithelial cells form a continuous
layer of polarized columnar cells that produce protein
secretions and express characteristic markers such as
cytokeratins 8 and 18, as well as high levels of AR. Basal
cells are located beneath the luminal epithelium, and
express p63 and the high-molecular-weight cytokeratins
5 and 14, but express AR at low or undetectable levels.
Finally, neuroendocrine cells are rare cells of unknown
function that express endocrine markers such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but are AR-negative.
Epithelial–mesenchymal interactions
The prostate is an endodermal tissue that arises during late
embryogenesis through ductal budding from the anterior
urogenital sinus epithelium. Formation of the prostate is
an inductive event that requires reciprocal interactions
between the urogenital sinus mesenchyme and epithelium, and is dependent on testicular androgen synthesis.
The fundamental parameters of these epithelial–mesenchymal interactions were defined in classical tissue recombination studies by Cunha and colleagues (Cunha
et al. 1987; Cunha 2008). These studies demonstrated that
an AR-dependent signal from the urogenital mesenchyme
is required for prostate formation, while AR is not initially
required in the urogenital epithelium for prostate organogenesis, but is subsequently necessary for epithelial differentiation and secretory protein expression. Thus, androgens act indirectly on the urogenital mesenchyme to
mediate prostate induction. These findings have been
subsequently confirmed by conditional gene targeting of
AR in the prostate epithelium (Wu et al. 2007).
More recently, molecular analyses have implicated
several developmental signaling pathways in mediating
epithelial–mesenchymal interactions during prostate organogenesis, including the Wnt, fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), and Hedgehog pathways (Marker et al. 2003; Prins
and Putz 2008). For example, ligands and inhibitors for
the canonical Wnt/b-catenin as well as noncanonical
pathways are expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments during early prostate organogenesis
(Pritchard and Nelson 2008), and abrogation of noncanonical Wnt5a signaling leads to defects in ductal morphogenesis (Huang et al. 2009). In addition, the FGF
pathway is clearly required for prostate formation, as
null mutants for the mesenchymally expressed Fgf10
mostly lack prostate budding (Donjacour et al. 2003),
while conditional deletion of Fgfr2, which encodes the
receptor for FGF10, or the downstream signaling component Frs2a in prostate epithelium results in defects in
branching morphogenesis (Lin et al. 2007; Zhang et al.
2008). Finally, the Hedgehog signaling pathway is also
involved in prostate formation, as the Shh ligand is
expressed in urogenital epithelium; the downstream
components Smo, Ptc1, and Gli1 are expressed in urogenital mesenchyme (Lamm et al. 2002; Freestone et al.

2003; Berman et al. 2004); and loss of Shh pathway
activity results in loss of prostate formation and/or defective ductal branching (Podlasek et al. 1999; Freestone
et al. 2003; Berman et al. 2004). However, it remains
unclear whether these phenotypes are mediated directly through redundant ligands functioning through
the Hedgehog pathway (Doles et al. 2006), or indirectly
through a reduction in androgen signaling (Freestone et al.
2003; Berman et al. 2004).
Natural history of prostate cancer
Latent and clinical cancer
Prostate cancer is generally regarded as multifocal, since
primary tumors often contain multiple independent
histologic foci of cancer that are often genetically distinct
(Aihara et al. 1994; Bostwick et al. 1998; Macintosh et al.
1998; Mehra et al. 2007a; Clark et al. 2008). In contrast,
despite the phenotypic heterogeneity of metastatic prostate cancer (Shah et al. 2004), molecular and cytogenetic
analyses show that multiple metastases in the same
patient are clonally related, indicating that advanced
prostate cancer is monoclonal (Mehra et al. 2008; Liu
et al. 2009). These findings suggest that metastatic
prostate cancer may arise from the selective advantage
of individual clones during cancer progression; however,
this process of clonal evolution may also represent the
consequence of therapeutic interventions such as androgen deprivation, which may differentially target cells of
varying malignant potential.
The heterogeneity of prostate cancer is potentially
relevant for understanding the distinction between latent
and clinical disease, and the strong correlation between
prostate cancer progression and aging (Fig. 1). Although
prostate cancer is a disease of older men, studies of
prostate specimens from healthy men in their 20s to 40s
show the frequent presence of histologic foci of prostate
cancer (Yatani et al. 1989; Sakr et al. 1994; Shiraishi et al.
1994), suggesting that cancer initiation has already taken
place at a relatively early age. Combined with the evidence
that prostate cancer is multifocal, it appears that the
prostate gland can be the site of multiple neoplastic
transformation events, many of which give rise only to
latent prostate cancer that does not progress to clinically
detectable disease. It is conceivable that clinical prostate
cancer initiates from a different pathogenic program than
latent prostate cancer. Alternatively, most latent prostate
cancer foci may not undergo critical activating events that
lead to clinical disease, or may remain under active
suppression sufficient to maintain these foci in a subclinical state. As discussed above, the advent of PSA screening
has led to a vast increase in the diagnoses of prostate
cancer, many of which presumably represent latent or
indolent forms of the disease that at present are difficult to
distinguish from cancers that will become more aggressive;
this highlights the critical need for improved molecular
markers and/or other approaches to augment the histological assessment of prostate cancer for more effective diagnosis and management.

Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)
and prostate cancer
It is widely accepted that PIN represents a precursor for
prostate cancer, although this relationship has not been
demonstrated conclusively (Bostwick 1989; DeMarzo et al.
2003). PIN is generally characterized at the histological
level by the appearance of luminal epithelial hyperplasia,
reduction in basal cells, enlargement of nuclei and nucleoli,
cytoplasmic hyperchromasia, and nuclear atypia; in addition, high-grade PIN lesions generally display marked
elevation of cellular proliferation markers (Bostwick
1989; Shappell et al. 2004). In contrast with prostate cancer,
however, basal cells are reduced in number in PIN, but are
not absent.
Although human prostate cancer displays significant
phenotypic heterogeneity, >95% of prostate cancers are
classified pathologically as adenocarcinoma, which has
a strikingly luminal phenotype (Fig. 2). In biopsy specimens, prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosis can be confirmed by the absence of immunostaining using p63 and
cytokeratin 5/14 antibodies, both of which detect basal

cells (Humphrey 2007; Grisanzio and Signoretti 2008). In
addition, a diagnosis of prostate cancer is supported by
elevated immunostaining for a-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), a luminal marker that is overexpressed
in carcinoma (Luo et al. 2002; Jiang et al. 2005; Humphrey
2007). Similarly, prostate cancer arising in many mouse
models displays a relatively luminal phenotype (Kim et al.
2002d; X Ma et al. 2005). However, the overt histological
appearance of prostate carcinoma in most genetically
engineered mouse models often differs from that of
typical human prostate cancer (Fig. 2).
Subtypes of prostate cancer
A notable difference between prostate cancer and other
epithelial tumors, such as breast cancer, is the lack of
distinguishable histopathological subtypes that differ in
their prognosis or treatment response. The vast majority
of prostate cancers correspond to acinar adenocarcinomas
that express AR, while other categories of prostate
cancer—such as ductal adenocarcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and signet ring carcinoma—are extremely rare

(Grignon 2004). Perhaps the most significant histological
variant is neuroendocrine prostate cancer, which is generally classified as either small cell carcinoma or a carcinoid tumor, and represents <2% of prostate cancer cases
(Grignon 2004). However, focal regions of neuroendocrine
differentiation are more commonly observed in prostate
adenocarcinoma, particularly following recurrence after
prostatectomy and androgen deprivation therapy (Yuan
et al. 2007; Komiya et al. 2009), and expression of the
neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A is associated
with the development of castration-resistant tumors
and shortened time to disease recurrence (Kokubo et al.
2005; Berruti et al. 2007). This prevalence of neuroendocrine differentiation after recurrence may be due to the
lack of AR expression by neuroendocrine cells, which are
inherently castration-resistant.
While evidence of major subtypes of prostate cancer is
lacking at the histopathological level, recent genomic
analyses have provided increasing evidence for molecularly defined subtypes (Tomlins et al. 2008b; Palanisamy
et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2010). In particular, expression
profiling analyses of prostate cancer specimens have not
strictly defined molecular signatures associated with
distinct cancer subtypes that specifically correlate with
disease outcome (Singh et al. 2002; Lapointe et al. 2004;
Tomlins et al. 2007b). However, oncogenomic pathway
analyses that integrate analyses of gene expression, copy
number alterations, and exon resequencing may provide
a unified approach for distinguishing prostate cancer subtypes and stratifying patient outcome (Taylor et al. 2010).
Furthermore, the existence of molecular subtypes has
been supported by analyses of chromosomal rearrangements associated with prostate cancer; for example, prostate cancers containing the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation
may be distinct from those that up-regulate SPINK1,
which encodes a secreted trypsin inhibitor (Mehra et al.
2007a; Tomlins et al. 2008b). Ongoing studies will undoubtedly assess whether these subtypes correlate with
disease outcome or treatment response.
Metastasis
As noted above, although common sites of secondary
metastasis for prostate cancer are lung, liver, and pleura,
if prostate cancer metastasizes, it invariably goes to
bone, where it forms characteristic osteoblastic lesions
(Bubendorf et al. 2000; Logothetis and Lin 2005). Given
the clinical importance of metastasis for patient outcome, the ability of prostate tumor cells to disseminate
into the bone marrow and peripheral blood has been
investigated in detail. Notably, a recent study showed
that bona fide circulating tumor cells could be detected in
the bone marrow of a significant proportion of patients
with localized disease, suggesting that disseminated tumor cells have not attained full metastatic capability
(Holcomb et al. 2008). Consistent with this interpretation, circulating tumor cells from patients with metastatic disease show multiple chromosomal rearrangements typical of advanced prostate cancer, consistent
with genomic instability acquired during cancer progres-

sion (Holcomb et al. 2008; Attard et al. 2009c; Leversha
et al. 2009). However, the relationship of disseminated
tumor cells to the formation of metastases remains unresolved, and the molecular factors that promote metastases of prostate cancer to bone are poorly defined.
Mouse models of prostate cancer
Xenograft models
Traditionally, in vivo studies of prostate cancer have
extensively used xenograft models of human prostate
cancer, using cell lines or prostate tumors implanted into
immunodeficient mice, either orthotopically into the
prostate or transplanted onto the flank. For instance,
xenografts derived from LNCaP cells have been used to
generate genetically-related lines that vary in their androgen responsivity and metastatic potential (Thalmann
et al. 2000). Similarly, several xenografts have been
developed by transplantation of human prostate tumors,
including the LuCaP and LAPC series, which display
a spectrum of prostate cancer phenotypes (Ellis et al.
1996; Craft et al. 1999b). Several of these human tissue
xenografts have also given rise to prostate cancer cell
lines, such as the VCaP line, which was derived from
a bone metastasis (Korenchuk et al. 2001).
Analyses of xenografts have yielded a vast amount of
information about molecular mechanisms of prostate
cancer, and have been useful for chemotherapeutic approaches. However, xenograft models are limited by a heterologous microenviroment (since human cells/tissues are
grafted in mice), an inability to analyze stromal components (unless orthotopic grafting is employed), the lack of
endogenous immune response (since the host mice are
immunodeficient), and the lack of diversity of available
established cell lines. In particular, the limited number of
available prostate cancer cell lines is likely related to
inherent difficulties in culturing luminal epithelial cells
(Peehl 2005) (existing prostate cell lines have been reviewed
in detail) (Sobel and Sadar 2005a,b). Of particular concern is
that existing cell lines may have uncertain origins, as has
been demonstrated for at least one ‘‘prostate’’ cell line that
was actually derived from a bladder carcinoma line (van
Bokhoven et al. 2001). Additionally, cell lines may have
anomalous molecular properties (e.g., loss of AR expression
and lack of TMPRSS2-ERG fusions) when compared with
most human prostate tumors (Sobel and Sadar 2005a,b),
which may limit their applicability. Nonetheless, xenograft
systems remain popular for studies of chemotherapeutics,
primarily due to their ease of use. Moreover, since they are
of human origin, xenografts may be more likely to recapitulate molecular events involved in human prostate
tumorigenesis than other experimental models.
Tissue reconstitution models
The tissue recombination and renal grafting methods
originally developed to study epithelial–mesenchymal
interactions during prostate organogenesis can be extended for investigation of prostate tumorigenesis in vivo.
In particular, immortalized human and mouse prostate

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

Shen and Abate-Shen

epithelial cell lines are available that can reconstitute
benign prostate tissue with relatively normal histology
following recombination with rodent embryonic urogenital mesenchyme and grafting into immunodeficient
recipients (Hayward et al. 2001; Gao et al. 2004a; Jiang
et al. 2010). Using such cell lines, gene expression can be
directly manipulated in culture by overexpression or
knockdown methods, followed by analysis of potential
tumor phenotypes in vivo. Similarly, stromal components
can also be investigated in tissue recombinants using
immortalized urogenital mesenchyme cell lines to facilitate genetic manipulation (Shaw et al. 2006), or using
carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (Olumi et al. 1999). Furthermore, this overall approach can been greatly extended
by efficient lentiviral infection of dissociated prostate
epithelial cells, followed by tissue recombination, allowing
for overexpression and knockdown approaches for analysis
of gene function (Xin et al. 2003, 2006; Zong et al. 2009).
Finally, grafting methods can be used to evaluate the
relative contribution of epithelial and stromal prostatic
components for cancer progression (Kim et al. 2002a; Jeong
et al. 2008), as well as to study cancer phenotypes in the
prostate glands of mouse strains that display embryonic
lethality, even prior to prostate formation (Wang et al.
2000). Thus, tissue reconstitution methods represent powerful approaches to studying cancer mechanisms in both
mouse and human prostates.
Genetically engineered models
The use of genetically engineered transgenic and knockout mice to produce autochthonous models of prostate
cancer has represented a major avenue for prostate cancer
investigations (Table 1). Most first-generation prostate
cancer models used transgenes that overexpress potent
viral oncogenes, resulting in highly aggressive disease
that can often lead to metastatic cancer (Winter et al.
2003; Kasper 2005). Among these models are the wellstudied TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the prostate) mouse, which carries a minimal probasin promoter
driving both SV40 large T and small t antigen (Greenberg
et al. 1995), and the LADY models that use a larger
probasin promoter and express large T antigen only
(Masumori et al. 2001). However, transgenic mice that
overexpress SV40 large T antigen typically have short
latency, and develop cancer with features of neuroendocrine differentiation (Kaplan-Lefko et al. 2003; Shappell
et al. 2004). Nonetheless, these first-generation models
have provided numerous important insights into prostate
cancer mechanisms.
A second generation of prostate cancer models has used
loss-of-function mutations in candidate genes implicated
in the genesis of human prostate cancer (Table 1). Several
popular models have employed null mutations in genes of
interest, including Nkx3.1 and Pten (phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) (discussed
below); for example, Nkx3.1; Pten double mutants show
accelerated formation of high-grade PIN and invasive
cancer (Kim et al. 2002d; Abate-Shen et al. 2003). Other
commonly used models have employed conditional de-

1972

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

letion mediated by the Pb-Cre4 transgene, which uses
a modified probasin promoter (ARR2PB) to drive Cre
expression in the prostate epithelium (Wu et al. 2001),
although a potential concern is that this Cre allele also
drives recombination in the stroma (X Wang and MM
Shen, unpubl.). The Pb-Cre4 driver has been used by
many laboratories for the conditional deletion of Pten as
well as other genes of interest (Wang et al. 2003; Z Chen
et al. 2005; Bruxvoort et al. 2007). Another popular Cre
driver is the Nkx3.1-Cre knock-in allele, which expresses
Cre recombinase specifically in the prostate epithelium,
but also in several other tissues during embryogenesis
(Stanfel et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007; Thomsen et al. 2008;
Zhang et al. 2008).
Despite much recent progress, current genetically
engineered models have several important limitations.
First, constitutive conditional gene deletion systems
generally result in deletion from early stages of prostate
organogenesis, and cannot be initiated in the adult, or in
a stochastic manner, as is the case with somatic mutations in human cancer. Thus, the development of an
inducible gene targeting system that can be induced in
adult prostate epithelium would allow the investigation
of gene function in situations where normal prostate
organogenesis would not proceed in the absence of the
gene of interest. Recent publications have described the
generation of tamoxifen-inducible Cre drivers that are
likely to be suitable for such approaches (Luchman et al.
2008; Ratnacaram et al. 2008; Birbach et al. 2009; Z Wang
et al. 2009). Second, the use of a reversible transgene
expression system, such as those driven by a tetracyclineregulated promoter, would allow the modeling of targeted
therapeutic interventions on cancer growth, as well as
potential acquisition of drug resistance and treatment
failure. Such tetracycline-regulated models have been used
successfully to investigate oncogene addiction in melanoma and mammary cancer models (Chin et al. 1999;
Moody et al. 2002), but have not yet been employed in the
prostate. Third, existing Cre drivers to investigate stromal
function in prostate carcinogenesis are limited and nonspecific (Jackson et al. 2008), with the best available driver
corresponding to the FSP1-Cre transgene (Bhowmick et al.
2004). Fourth, all current prostate cancer models use
androgen-dependent promoters to drive the cancer phenotype, either directly or indirectly, and thus are poorly suited
to investigate the effects of modulating androgen levels,
since androgen deprivation will simultaneously downregulate transgene expression. Finally, at present, there is
no autochthonous model that reliably displays bone metastasis, which represents a major limitation in the study of
advanced prostate cancer.
Nonetheless, despite their limitations, analyses of
genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer
have significantly advanced our understanding of the
molecular pathways of prostate cancer initiation, progression, and castration resistance. Additionally, investigations of genetically engineered mice have led to the
identification of biomarkers that can predict disease
recurrence, and have provided valuable preclinical resources for investigations of novel therapies and analyses
